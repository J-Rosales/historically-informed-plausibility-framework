# NARRATIVE CONSTITUTION
Structural Guardrails for Historically-Informed Narrative Plausibility

This document defines the **rules of plausibility** governing narrative production in any compatible world repository.  
It does not describe events, truths, or facts.  
It constrains how societies, polities, and cultures are allowed to behave over time.

The purpose of this constitution is to prevent shallow, frictionless, or monocausal narratives while preserving ambiguity, contradiction, and perspective.

---

## I. Scope and Non-Scope

### In Scope
- Diegetic narratives (chronicles, laws, myths, histories, poems)
- Quasi-diegetic analyses written from in-universe standpoints
- Narrative answers to “why,” “how,” and “what would make sense”

### Out of Scope
- Assertion extraction
- Canon resolution
- Ontological truth
- Mechanical simulation

This constitution governs **narrative plausibility**, not epistemic certainty.

---

## II. Foundational Principles

### 1. Overdetermination
No major outcome arises from a single cause.

Political change, military defeat, reform, collapse, or religious transformation must reflect **multiple converging pressures**, even if narrators perceive only one.

Narratives may simplify.  
The world must not.

---

### 2. Friction
Intent does not guarantee outcome.

All actions encounter friction from:
- limited information
- administrative weakness
- resistance or avoidance
- geography and material limits
- competing incentives

Narratives that move cleanly from decision to result are invalid unless the text itself signals exceptional circumstances.

---

### 3. Misperception
Actors do not see the full causal field.

Decisions are made under:
- partial knowledge
- ideological distortion
- factional interest
- retrospective rationalization

Correct outcomes may arise accidentally; incorrect ones may appear rational at the time.

---

### 4. Asymmetry of Belief and Effect
What people believe explains their actions, not necessarily the world’s response.

Doctrines, ideologies, and sacred interpretations:
- often lag material change
- often sanctify new power relations
- often reinterpret failure as necessity or virtue

Belief coherence is not causal coherence.

---

## III. Structural Stress Fields

All societies are continuously shaped by the following pressures, whether mentioned or not.  
Narratives must show their fingerprints, implicitly or explicitly.

### A. Demographic Stress
- population growth or decline
- age structure (youth bulges, aging elites)
- migration and displacement

Effects include radicalization, militarization, religious ferment, elite competition.

---

### B. Elite Competition Stress
- surplus of elite aspirants
- factional rivalry
- redistribution of prestige after shocks

Effects include intrigue, doctrinal schism, reform rhetoric masking power struggle.

---

### C. Fiscal and Administrative Stress
- revenue stability or improvisation
- ability to count, extract, enforce
- corruption and leakage

Effects include uneven enforcement, symbolic reforms, policy oscillation.

---

### D. Legitimacy Stress
- moral bargains between rulers and ruled
- competing bases of legitimacy
- exclusion and scapegoating

Effects include ritual reform, purges, sacralization of authority, revolt.

---

### E. Coordination and Information Stress
- principal–agent problems
- rumor vs command
- delayed or distorted information

Effects include failed campaigns, contradictory orders, policy incoherence.

---

### F. Ecological and Material Stress
- harvest variability
- climate shocks
- resource bottlenecks

Effects include war timing, migration, doctrinal reinterpretation of disaster.

---

## IV. Rules for Political and Institutional Change

### 1. Capacity Precedes Reform
Reforms require tools, personnel, and compliance.

If a polity cannot measure, enforce, or communicate a policy, the narrative must show failure, partial success, or symbolic substitution.

---

### 2. Coalition Constraint
Sustained governance requires support from a ruling coalition.

After shocks (defeat, succession, famine):
- coalitions fragment
- loyalty becomes expensive
- reforms provoke resistance

Policy change without coalition logic is implausible.

---

### 3. Path Dependence
Institutions change incrementally.

Sudden transformation requires:
- shock
- elite turnover
- or bypassing of veto players

Otherwise, expect inertia and workaround behavior.

---

## V. Rules for Conflict and War Narratives

### 1. Numbers Do Not Fight
Military outcomes depend on:
- logistics
- cohesion and training
- command and control
- morale and legitimacy
- terrain and weather
- intelligence and deception

High numbers without organization do not confer advantage.

---

### 2. Defeat Produces Noise, Not Clarity
After military failure:
- blame proliferates
- narratives diverge
- ideology hardens
- policy oscillates

Avoid clean “lesson learned → reform enacted” arcs.

---

## VI. Narrative Legitimacy

Narratives are allowed to be:
- biased
- incomplete
- polemical
- wrong

They are not allowed to be:
- frictionless
- monocausal
- omniscient
- structurally impossible

---

## VII. Consequences for Narrative Generation

A narrative is implausible if it:
- ignores structural stress entirely
- attributes systemic change to personal will alone
- resolves major crises cleanly
- assumes universal compliance
- collapses belief, intention, and outcome into one plane

A narrative is strong if:
- it embeds tension without resolving it
- it allows multiple interpretations
- it leaves room for later contradiction
