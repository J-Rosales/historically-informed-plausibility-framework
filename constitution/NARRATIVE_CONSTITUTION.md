# NARRATIVE CONSTITUTION

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the non-negotiable principles governing all narrative work produced using the historically informed plausibility framework.

Its purpose is to define **hard boundaries**, not methods; **constraints**, not tools; and **prohibitions**, not guidance.  
It exists to prevent implausible outcomes regardless of genre, setting, or authorial preference.

This document is authoritative across all frameworks, templates, examples, and implementations that claim conformance with this repository.

## I. Foundational Commitments

### I.1 Plausibility as Structural Constraint

Narrative outcomes must be constrained by structural conditions inherent to the systems depicted.  
Plausibility is treated as a limiting factor on what may occur, not as an aesthetic preference.

### I.2 Rejection of Authorial Fiat

No outcome may be justified solely by authorial intent, narrative necessity, or thematic desirability.  
All significant developments must be explainable without recourse to omniscient or unbounded intervention.

### I.3 Systemic Causality

Historical and fictional systems are assumed to operate according to pressures, frictions, and constraints that persist independently of individual intent or awareness.

Actors may misunderstand, misjudge, or fail to perceive these forces without negating their effect.

### I.4 Non-Exceptionalism

Individuals, institutions, and cultures are not exempt from systemic constraint by virtue of talent, virtue, destiny, or narrative centrality.

Exceptional actors may alter trajectories, but they do not suspend structure.

## II. Authority and Precedence

### II.1 Hierarchy of Authority

In cases of conflict or ambiguity, authority is resolved in the following order:

1. This Constitution  
2. Framework documents (`*_FRAMEWORK.md`)  
3. Templates (`*_TEMPLATE.md`)  
4. Examples (`examples/`)  
5. World or implementation repositories

Lower-level documents may not override higher-level constraints.

### II.2 Binding Scope

All frameworks, templates, examples, and implementations claiming adherence to this repository are bound by this constitution.

No document may claim exemption.

---

## III. Mandatory Plausibility Disciplines

The following disciplines are mandatory at a conceptual level, though their implementation is unconstrained:

### III.1 Structural Explainability

Every major narrative outcome must be explainable through identifiable structural conditions.

### III.2 Cost and Resistance

Change must incur cost, delay, opposition, or degradation proportional to its scope.

### III.3 Stress Sensitivity

Long-lived systems must exhibit vulnerability to accumulated stress and shock.

### III.4 Bounded Knowledge and Coordination

Actors operate under incomplete information and limited coordination unless explicit mechanisms justify otherwise.

---

## IV. Prohibited Narrative Violations

The following are categorically disallowed:

### IV.1 Costless Reform

Large-scale reform without resistance, delay, or tradeoff.

### IV.2 Infinite Resilience

Institutions or systems that absorb unlimited stress without degradation.

### IV.3 Universal Rationality

Assumptions that all actors respond optimally, consistently, or identically to incentives.

### IV.4 Instantaneous Recovery

Recovery from shock without time, resource expenditure, or structural change.

### IV.5 Perfect Information

Actors possessing accurate, comprehensive knowledge without credible informational infrastructure.

### IV.6 Singular Justification

Outcomes justified solely by the actions, virtues, or insight of exceptional individuals.

---

## V. Scope Limitations

This constitution explicitly does **not** govern:

- World-specific facts or canon  
- Genre, theme, or moral interpretation  
- Aesthetic or stylistic choices  
- Enumeration of analytical constructs  
- Selection or definition of specific tools, lattices, or lenses

These concerns belong to frameworks or implementations.

---

## VI. Interpretive Discipline

### VI.1 Conservative Interpretation

Ambiguity shall be resolved toward increased constraint rather than expanded freedom.

### VI.2 Constraint Preference

When multiple explanations are possible, preference is given to those that impose greater structural limitation on future outcomes.

### VI.3 Non-Expansion Principle

Interpretation of this constitution must not be used to justify new freedoms, only to clarify existing limits.

---

## VII. Amendment and Revision

### VII.1 Amendment Threshold

Amendments to this constitution are permitted only to resolve ambiguity, contradiction, or omission that undermines enforceability.

### VII.2 Restrictive Direction

All amendments must reduce interpretive latitude, not increase it.

### VII.3 Prohibited Amendments

Amendments may not:
- Enumerate content
- Introduce world-specific assumptions
- Define analytical methods or constructs

---

## Closing Principle

This constitution exists to **limit**, not inspire.

Creativity occurs within the boundaries it establishes; plausibility is preserved by enforcing those boundaries without exception.

Anything that cannot survive these constraints does not belong within this framework.
