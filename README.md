# Historically Informed Plausibility Framework

This repository defines a **constraint-based framework** for evaluating historical and narrative plausibility.

It is designed for authors, historians, and worldbuilders who want to test whether a narrative claim is **structurally admissible**—not whether it is likely, conventional, or genre-appropriate.

The framework evaluates **impossibility and violation**, not probability or realism scores.

## How This Repository Is Meant to Be Used

This repository is a **reference and authority repository**.

You are **not** expected to:
- fork it,
- modify it,
- or add world-specific content to it.

Instead, you should:

1. Create **your own repository** for your fictional world, historical project, or narrative corpus.
2. Treat this repository as a **stable external reference**.
3. Link to its documents when defining:
   - world constraints,
   - belief regimes,
   - lattices,
   - evaluation procedures,
   - or agent behavior.

Your project *depends on* this framework; it does not extend it.

## Where to Start

Your entry point depends on what you are trying to do.

### If you are new to the framework
Start here:
1. `constitution/NARRATIVE_CONSTITUTION.md`  
   Non-negotiable principles and prohibitions.
2. `rationale/FRAMEWORK_RATIONALE.md`  
   Why the framework is structured the way it is.

These documents define the **philosophy and limits** of the system.

---

### If you are defining a new world or setting
Start here:
1. `world/framework/BASELINE_WORLD_CONSTRAINTS_FRAMEWORK.md`  
2. `world/templates/WORLD_CONSTRAINTS_TEMPLATE.md`

Baseline world constraints define what kinds of mechanisms can exist **at all** in your narrative universe.

You should copy the *templates* into your own repository, not edit them here.

---

### If you are modeling historical or narrative change
Start here:
1. `change_entries/HISTORICAL_CHANGE_ENTRY_FRAMEWORK.md`

This document defines the canonical units of change used by the framework.

---

### If you are evaluating a narrative claim
Start here:
1. `evaluation/ENTRY_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md`  
2. `evaluation/PLAUSIBILITY_EVALUATION_FRAMEWORK.md`

Claims that fail entry validation are rejected before plausibility evaluation begins.

---

### If you are building analytical structure
Refer to the relevant subsystems:
- `lattices/` — structural constraints and failure modes  
- `lenses/` — interpretive modifiers  
- `belief_regimes/` — socially operative belief systems  
- `corpus/` — diegetic evidence and sources  

Each subsystem contains:
- a framework (authoritative),
- templates (to copy),
- and examples (illustrative only).

---

## What This Framework Does *Not* Do

- It does not predict outcomes.
- It does not rank plausibility numerically.
- It does not grant genre-based permission.
- It does not replace historical scholarship or narrative craft.

---

## Typical Workflow

1. Create a new repository for your world or project.
2. Copy relevant templates from this repository into it.
3. Declare baseline world constraints.
4. Define belief regimes, lattices, and institutions.
5. Instantiate historical change entries.
6. Evaluate claims using this framework as reference authority.

This repository is a **methodological specification**, not a content canon.  
Authority resides in the frameworks, not in examples.
