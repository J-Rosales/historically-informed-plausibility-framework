# BASELINE_WORLD_CONSTRAINTS_FRAMEWORK

## Purpose and Scope

This document defines how a world declares its **baseline structural constraints** prior to any plausibility evaluation.

Baseline world constraints establish:
- what kinds of mechanisms can exist at all,
- which domains of action are structurally possible,
- and which classes of claims are category-invalid before analysis begins.

This framework does **not** authorize outcomes, define technologies, or grant narrative permission.  
It defines the **constraint envelope** within which all historical change, lattices, and evaluations occur.

Baseline constraints apply globally and precede all other analytical structures.

## I. Governing Principle

> **Undeclared capability defaults to constraint, not freedom.**

If a mechanism is not supported by baseline constraints, any claim depending on it is invalid at entry validation.

Baseline constraints define *possibility space*, not plausibility within that space.

---

## II. Role in the Analytical Hierarchy

Baseline world constraints operate **above**:
- historical change entries,
- consequence lattices,
- analytical lenses,
- belief regimes,
- and corpus documents.

They are inherited by all downstream structures and are not overridden by them.

---

## III. What Baseline Constraints Are (and Are Not)

### III.1 Baseline Constraints Are

- Declarative
- Structural
- Global
- Pre-analytical

They describe the **existence of mechanism classes**, not their implementation.

---

### III.2 Baseline Constraints Are Not

- Genre switches
- Narrative permissions
- Probability adjustments
- Exemptions from cost or consequence

Declaring a mechanism possible does **not** make its use trivial, cheap, or stable.

---

## IV. Constraint Domains

Worlds declare baseline constraints by addressing the following **domains**.  
These domains are abstract and non-enumerative.

### IV.1 Physical Reach

Defines the spatial and physical extent of possible movement and interaction.

Examples of considerations:
- terrestrial only
- planetary
- interplanetary
- interstellar
- non-spatial domains

---

### IV.2 Energetic Capacity

Defines the scale of energy manipulation available to actors or systems.

Examples of considerations:
- biological limits
- mechanical augmentation
- industrial energy
- stellar-scale systems
- non-energetic causal forces

---

### IV.3 Ontological Layers

Defines whether causally effective domains exist beyond the observable physical world.

Examples of considerations:
- strictly material
- metaphysical but inert
- metaphysical and causally interactive
- multiple interacting ontological strata

---

### IV.4 Technological or Infrastructural Ceiling

Defines the highest level of durable, reproducible infrastructure possible.

Examples of considerations:
- pre-industrial
- industrial
- post-industrial
- post-scarcity
- non-technological infrastructure

---

### IV.5 Epistemic Access

Defines what kinds of information can be reliably known, observed, or verified.

Examples of considerations:
- local and experiential knowledge only
- systematic record-keeping
- remote sensing
- predictive modeling
- privileged or asymmetrical knowledge sources

---

### IV.6 Agency and Embodiment

Defines the nature and limits of actors.

Examples of considerations:
- embodied biological agents only
- augmented or collective agents
- artificial or non-corporeal agents
- distributed or emergent agency

---

## V. Constraint Interaction and Non-Implication

Declaring a domain permissive does **not** imply:
- universal access,
- uniform distribution,
- low cost,
- or social acceptance.

All such factors remain subject to:
- consequence lattices,
- belief regimes,
- institutional capacity,
- legitimacy dynamics.

---

## VI. Default Assumptions in the Absence of Declaration

When a world does not explicitly declare a baseline constraint domain:

- Physical reach defaults to local and terrestrial.
- Energetic capacity defaults to biological and mechanical limits.
- Ontological layers default to causally inert or absent.
- Technological ceiling defaults to pre-industrial.
- Epistemic access defaults to local and incomplete.
- Agency defaults to embodied, bounded actors.

These defaults are conservative and may be overridden only by explicit declaration.

---

## VII. Relationship to Plausibility Evaluation

During evaluation:

- Claims violating baseline constraints are rejected at entry validation.
- Claims permitted by baseline constraints proceed to lattice-based analysis.
- Baseline constraints are never sufficient justification for outcomes.

Baseline constraints define **what may be analyzed**, not **what passes analysis**.

---

## VIII. Revision and Stability

Baseline constraints should be:
- few,
- stable,
- and rarely revised.

Altering baseline constraints retroactively invalidates prior evaluations.

Such revisions must be treated as **world-redefinition events**, not incremental changes.

---

## Guiding Principle

> Baseline constraints define the edges of the possible.  
> Plausibility evaluation determines what survives within those edges.

A world is not defined by what it allows,  
but by what it structurally cannot do.
