# EXAMPLE_CONSEQUENCE_LATTICE_ADMINISTRATIVE_CAPACITY.md

## Lattice Name

Administrative Capacity

---

## 1. Domain Scope

This lattice governs the ability of a polity or institution to **formulate, transmit, and execute decisions across its claimed territory**.

It includes bureaucratic reach, record-keeping, manpower, and procedural coherence.
It explicitly excludes legitimacy, belief, and willingness to comply except insofar as they affect execution.

---

## 2. Trigger Variables

* Territorial expansion or contraction
* Population growth or decline
* Fiscal stress or windfalls
* Legal or procedural proliferation
* Loss of trained administrators (death, exile, purges)

These triggers operate independently of intent or ideological commitment.

---

## 3. State Levels

**Coherent**
Administrative routines are understood, staffed, and repeatable; decisions propagate reliably.

**Strained**
Execution is uneven; delays, local improvisation, and selective enforcement appear.

**Fragmented**
Central directives are routinely ignored, misunderstood, or contradicted by local practice.

**Nonfunctional**
The institution cannot reliably act as a unit; authority exists mostly on paper.

---

## 4. Propagation Rules

* Capacity degrades faster than it can be rebuilt.
* Procedural complexity accelerates decline under strain.
* Recovery requires generational time horizons unless assisted by external structures.

Transitions are typically slow and cumulative, not abrupt.

---

## 5. Outputs and Constraints

At higher strain levels:

* Laws cannot be uniformly enforced.
* Reforms fail regardless of intent.
* Coercive power becomes localized.
* Central planning becomes performative rather than operative.

Certain actions (e.g., mass mobilization, legal standardization) become implausible.

---

## 6. Failure Modes

When saturated, administrative capacity collapses into:

* De facto local autonomy
* Patronage substitution for procedure
* Legal pluralism without coordination

These persist even if recognized by leadership.

---

## 7. Typical Evidence

* Conflicting or duplicated records
* Orders repeatedly reissued without effect
* Local officials acting beyond formal authority
* Absence of enforcement documentation

Silence in expected administrative archives is itself evidence.

---

## 8. Overlap and Orthogonality Analysis

Overlaps with:

* Legitimacy Strain (authority acceptance)
* Incentive Alignment (official behavior)

Distinct because:

* Capacity failure prevents execution even when legitimacy and incentives remain intact.

It introduces the failure mode: *“correct decisions that cannot be carried out.”*

---

## 9. Notes on Lens Interaction (Optional)

Common modifying lenses include:

* Cultural Compliance Pressure
* Ritual Potency Decay
* Professional Habitus Norms

These affect *how* capacity strain is expressed, not whether it exists.
