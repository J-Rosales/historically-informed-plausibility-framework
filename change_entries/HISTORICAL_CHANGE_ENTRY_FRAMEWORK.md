# HISTORICAL_CHANGE_ENTRY_FRAMEWORK

## Purpose and Scope

This document defines the **canonical types of historical change entries** used to analyze, document, and test narratives within the historically informed plausibility framework.

It establishes:
- which kinds of change may be treated as first-class analytical entries,
- how those entry types differ,
- and how they relate to one another.

This framework does **not** enumerate specific events, crises, or conditions.  
It defines the *ontology of change*, not its content.

---

## I. Governing Principle

Historical change is not homogeneous.

Different kinds of change:
- enter the record differently,
- are experienced differently by actors,
- and interact with structural constraints in distinct ways.

A canonical entry type exists **only** if it represents a fundamentally different way that change operates or is perceived.

---

## II. Canonical Entry Types

The framework recognizes **five** canonical entry types.  
This set is intentionally minimal and exhaustive.

---

### II.1 Event

#### Definition  
An **Event** is a temporally bounded occurrence that actors experience as discrete and after which the system is not identical to its prior state.

#### Core Characteristics
- Bounded in time (even if fuzzily)
- Has identifiable participants
- Produces immediate consequences
- Does not, by itself, alter systemic rules

#### Role in Analysis
Events are the primary anchors for:
- narrative sequencing,
- corpus documentation,
- and actor-level agency.

Events are **experienced**, recorded, and remembered as happenings.

---

### II.2 Process

#### Definition  
A **Process** is a temporally extended sequence of change that incrementally alters system state without a single decisive moment.

#### Core Characteristics
- Extended duration
- Gradual accumulation
- Often invisible to contemporaries
- Detectable primarily in retrospect

#### Role in Analysis
Processes explain:
- erosion,
- adaptation,
- drift,
- and long-term transformation without punctuated rupture.

Processes prevent false event-centrism.

---

### II.3 Structural Transformation

#### Definition  
A **Structural Transformation** is a change that alters the **rules of operation** of one or more systems, not merely their state.

#### Core Characteristics
- Modifies constraints, not just outcomes
- Often path-dependent
- Frequently irreversible
- May lack a clear initiating moment

#### Role in Analysis
Structural transformations are where:
- consequence lattices change regime,
- irreversibility emerges,
- and new forms of plausibility replace old ones.

They explain why “things can no longer work as they once did.”

---

### II.4 Condition (Derived Entry)

#### Definition  
A **Condition** is a persistent background constraint that shapes events and processes but is not itself an occurrence.

#### Core Characteristics
- Long duration
- Low visibility
- Modulates rather than acts
- May persist without observable change

#### Derived Status  
Conditions are **secondary analytical entries**.

They must be:
- derived from events and processes,
- explicitly justified,
- and treated as constraint states rather than causes.

#### Role in Analysis
Conditions explain:
- why similar events have different outcomes,
- why options appear closed or costly,
- why systems behave “as if constrained.”

---

### II.5 Crisis (Derived Entry)

#### Definition  
A **Crisis** is a period in which multiple systems enter high strain simultaneously, compressing decision time and amplifying consequences.

#### Core Characteristics
- Time-compressed
- Multi-domain
- High uncertainty
- Disproportionate impact of decisions

#### Derived Status  
Crises are **secondary analytical entries**.

They must be:
- grounded in overlapping events and processes,
- justified by demonstrable strain convergence,
- and bounded temporally, even if imprecisely.

#### Role in Analysis
Crises explain:
- breakdowns of normal decision logic,
- legitimacy shocks,
- rapid escalation and collapse dynamics.

They capture **perceived emergency**, not just objective stress.

---

## III. Primary vs. Derived Entries

### III.1 Primary Entries
- Event
- Process
- Structural Transformation

These may be authored directly.

### III.2 Derived Entries
- Condition
- Crisis

These may **not** stand alone and require explicit derivation.

---

## IV. Derivation Requirements for Conditions and Crises

Any Condition or Crisis entry **must include**:

1. **Derived From**  
   A list of events and/or processes from which it is inferred.

2. **Justification of Classification**  
   Explanation of why this entry is not reducible to:
   - a single event, or
   - a single continuous process.

3. **Actor Recognition**  
   Whether contemporaries perceived this state explicitly, implicitly, or not at all.

4. **Constraint Description**  
   What options become restricted, distorted, or salient under this condition or crisis.

Absent these, the entry is invalid.

---

## V. Reduction Rule (Mandatory)

Every historical or narrative claim must be reducible to one or more canonical entry types.

| Claim | Reduction |
|-----|-----------|
| “The empire declined” | Process + Condition |
| “The church split” | Crisis + Structural Transformation |
| “Reform failed” | Event + Condition |
| “Nothing happened for decades” | Process (stability) |

Claims that cannot be reduced are ill-formed.

---

## VI. Excluded Entry Types

The following are **explicitly excluded** as primary entry types:

- Periods or eras  
- Actors or individuals  
- Institutions  
- Cultures or peoples  

These may appear *within* entries but are not themselves analytical units of change.

---

## VII. Relationship to Other Framework Components

Historical change entries:
- interact with **consequence lattices** to test plausibility,
- are interpreted through **analytical lenses**,
- are evidenced by **corpus documents**,
- and are contextualized by **belief regimes**.

They do not replace these structures; they operationalize them.

---

## Guiding Principle

> Events happen.  
> Processes unfold.  
> Structures change.  
> Conditions constrain.  
> Crises compress.

Historical plausibility emerges from their disciplined interaction, not from narrative assertion.
