# WORLD_CONSTRAINTS_TEMPLATE

## Purpose

This document declares the **baseline structural constraints** of a *world*.

In this framework, **“world” does not mean a literal planet**.  
It refers to a **narrative universe, setting, or intellectual property** within which stories, histories, or analyses take place.

A world may include:
- multiple planets or realms,
- a single city or region,
- a bounded historical period,
- or an abstract narrative space.

This document defines the **possibility envelope** inherited by all historical change entries, consequence lattices, belief regimes, and plausibility evaluations within that narrative universe.

It does **not** authorize specific outcomes, events, or narratives.  
It declares only what kinds of mechanisms **can exist at all**.

Undeclared capabilities default to constraint.

## I. World Identification

**World / Setting Name:**  
**Narrative Scope:**  
(e.g. entire universe, single realm, historical era, campaign setting)

**Version / Date:**  

---

## II. Constraint Declaration Principles

- Declarations must be **structural**, not narrative.
- Declarations must describe **existence of mechanism classes**, not implementations.
- Absence of declaration implies **non-existence**.
- Permission does not imply ease, scale, or ubiquity.

---

## III. Baseline Constraint Domains

Complete each section with concise declarative statements.  
Avoid examples, stories, or justifications.

---

### III.1 Physical Reach

Describe the maximum spatial and physical extent of possible movement and interaction **within the narrative universe**.

**Declared Constraint:**
-  

**Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**
-  

---

### III.2 Energetic Capacity

Describe the scale of energy manipulation that can exist in durable, repeatable form.

**Declared Constraint:**
-  

**Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**
-  

---

### III.3 Ontological Layers

Describe whether causally effective domains exist beyond the observable physical layer of the narrative universe.

**Declared Constraint:**
-  

**Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**
-  

---

### III.4 Technological / Infrastructural Ceiling

Describe the highest level of reproducible infrastructure possible within the setting.

**Declared Constraint:**
-  

**Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**
-  

---

### III.5 Epistemic Access

Describe what kinds of information can be reliably known, observed, or verified by actors.

**Declared Constraint:**
-  

**Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**
-  

---

### III.6 Agency and Embodiment

Describe the nature and limits of actors capable of effecting change in the narrative universe.

**Declared Constraint:**
-  

**Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**
-  

---

## IV. Explicit Exclusions (Optional but Recommended)

List any domains or mechanisms that are **explicitly impossible** within this narrative universe, to prevent ambiguity.

**Explicit Exclusions:**
-  

---

## V. Inheritance and Overrides

Specify whether this document:
- fully defines baseline constraints for this world, or
- inherits from another world or meta-setting.

If inheritance applies, specify which constraints are overridden.

**Inheritance Source (if any):**
-  

**Overrides (if any):**
-  

---

## VI. Stability Declaration

Indicate whether these baseline constraints are expected to remain stable across the narrative scope.

- ☐ Stable and fixed  
- ☐ Stable with rare redefinition events  
- ☐ Transitional (explicitly subject to change)

If transitional, describe how constraint changes will be represented (e.g. structural transformation entries).
