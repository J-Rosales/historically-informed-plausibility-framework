# EXAMPLE_ANALYTICAL_LENS_CULTURAL_COMPLIANCE_PRESSURE.md

## Lens Name

Cultural Compliance Pressure

---

## 1. Domain of Application

Primarily modifies:

* Administrative Capacity
* Legitimacy Strain

Secondarily affects:

* Coercive Capacity

---

## 2. Contextual Basis

This lens operates in societies where:

* Social reputation strongly conditions opportunity.
* Deviance is interpreted symbolically, not neutrally.
* Actors anticipate how *others* will read their behavior.

It is culture-specific and historically contingent.

---

## 3. Mechanism of Action

Actors comply with expected behaviors not because they endorse them, but because **noncompliance alters how others interpret and respond to them**.

Behavior is shaped by second-order expectations rather than belief.

---

## 4. Threshold Effects

* A single visible deviation may trigger disproportionate reputational loss.
* Silence or restraint may be read as weakness or disloyalty.
* Overcompliance can become mandatory to avoid suspicion.

Thresholds are socially enforced, not formally codified.

---

## 5. Typical Expressions

* Participation in feuds, rituals, or displays despite private reluctance
* Excessive formality in official conduct
* Performative enforcement of norms by peers
* Punishment of restraint as deviance

---

## 6. Interaction with Lattice States

* **Coherent Capacity:** compliance smooths administration by reducing enforcement costs.
* **Strained Capacity:** compliance masks dysfunction, delaying recognition.
* **Fragmented Capacity:** compliance becomes localized and factional.
* **Nonfunctional Capacity:** compliance rituals persist even as administration collapses.

---

## 7. Decay or Saturation Modes

* Overuse leads to performativity without substance.
* Widespread cynicism erodes signaling value.
* Norms invert, rewarding defiance instead of adherence.

The lens weakens as shared interpretation erodes.

---

## 8. Non-Gating Declaration

This lens does **not** independently constrain plausibility.

Administrative systems may still function or fail without it; the lens only explains *why actors behave as they do within those constraints*.

---

## 9. Notes on Promotion (Optional)

In settings where cultural enforcement entirely replaces formal institutions, this lens may approach lattice-like behavior, but only when it independently produces structural impossibility.
