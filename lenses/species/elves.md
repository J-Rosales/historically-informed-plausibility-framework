# Lens: Elves (Species)

## Applies To
- Species: Elves

## Primary Modulations
This lens increases the salience of:
- recovery horizons after population loss
- elite loss as state-capacity loss
- institutional inertia and trauma persistence
- casualty intolerance and war avoidance

## Consequence Channel Salience
When running consequence lattices, prioritize:
- Elite continuity (loss compounds over centuries)
- Institutional continuity (skills/office memory embodied in individuals)
- Neighbor reaction (external opportunism becomes existential)
- Land use (abandonment and rewilding persist across long horizons)
- Legitimacy & belief (trauma becomes doctrine; reform becomes taboo)

## Common Misreadings to Flag
- assuming rapid recovery or replacement
- treating elven war losses as cyclical
- treating reform as incremental and frequent
- assuming short political memories or short-lived grudges
