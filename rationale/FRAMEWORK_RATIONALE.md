# FRAMEWORK_RATIONALE

## Purpose

This document records the **design rationale** behind the Historically Informed Plausibility Framework.

It explains **why specific architectural choices were made**, why plausible alternatives were rejected, and what intellectual traditions inform the framework’s structure. It exists to make the framework **legible, defensible, and stable**, not to introduce new rules.

This document is **non-authoritative**.  
It does not override the Constitution, frameworks, or templates.  
Its function is justificatory, not prescriptive.

## I. Guiding Design Philosophy

The framework is built around a single core conviction:

> **Historical plausibility is best enforced by identifying what cannot happen, not by predicting what will.**

Accordingly, the framework prioritizes:
- constraint over probability,
- structure over narrative coherence,
- falsification over explanation,
- actor limitation over omniscient narration.

This places it closer to:
- historical sociology,
- systems failure analysis,
- and critical historiography,

than to predictive modeling, storytelling guides, or simulation.

## II. Why the Framework Rejects Prediction and Probability

### Alternatives Considered
- Quantitative modeling (e.g., cliodynamics)
- Probability scoring of narrative outcomes
- Likelihood or realism ratings

### Why They Were Rejected
- Historical systems are underdetermined and path-dependent.
- Probability claims require datasets and assumptions unavailable to most fictional or qualitative historical work.
- Likelihood judgments collapse into intuition or analogy.
- Predictive frameworks privilege regularity over contingency.

### Chosen Approach
The framework evaluates **impossibility and violation**, not likelihood.

An outcome is implausible if it:
- violates known structural constraints,
- requires costless transformation,
- or depends on systemic exceptionalism.

This mirrors engineering safety logic and historical sociology rather than econometrics.

---

## III. Why Structural Constraints Are Modeled Qualitatively

### Alternatives Considered
- Numeric thresholds
- Scoring systems
- Weighted causal graphs

### Why They Were Rejected
- Numeric systems imply precision that cannot be justified.
- Scores create false comparability across contexts.
- Weighted models obscure causal opacity and actor misperception.

### Chosen Approach
Constraints are modeled as **qualitative lattices**:
- capable of saturation,
- capable of interaction,
- capable of failure,
- but not reducible to metrics.

This preserves rigor without false exactitude.

## IV. Why Historical Change Is Limited to Five Canonical Entry Types

### The Canonical Types
- Event
- Process
- Structural Transformation
- Condition (derived)
- Crisis (derived)

### Alternatives Considered
- Periods or eras
- Actors or individuals
- Institutions
- Cultures or civilizations
- Trends or movements as primary units

### Why These Were Rejected
- Periods summarize change but do not cause it.
- Actors invite exceptionalism and narrative centrality.
- Institutions persist across multiple change modes.
- Cultures are too diffuse to serve as causal units.
- Trends conflate description with explanation.

### Why the Chosen Set Is Sufficient
The five types represent **distinct modes by which change enters history**:
- discrete occurrence,
- gradual accumulation,
- rule alteration,
- persistent constraint,
- compressed instability.

They span:
- time scales,
- visibility,
- agency,
- and system impact,

without redundancy.

## V. Why Conditions and Crises Are Derived, Not Primitive

### Alternatives Considered
- Treating conditions and crises as first-class, standalone entities
- Inferring them implicitly without documentation

### Why Both Extremes Were Rejected
- Primitive treatment reifies abstractions and invites fiat.
- Pure inference hides actor perception and analytical assumptions.

### Chosen Approach
Conditions and crises are **explicit but derived**:
- they must reference underlying events and processes,
- they must justify their classification,
- they must specify how constraints are altered.

This preserves rigor while modeling how actors experience constraint and emergency.

---

## VI. Why Belief Regimes Are Defined at the Actor Level

### Alternatives Considered
- Broad umbrella belief systems
- Theology-centered categorization
- Modern taxonomic groupings

### Why They Were Rejected
- Umbrella systems erase functional differences.
- Theology alone does not determine legitimacy or authority.
- Modern categories misrepresent historical cognition.

### Chosen Approach
Belief regimes are defined as **socially operative meaning systems**:
- differentiated by authority logic,
- legitimacy criteria,
- boundary enforcement,
- and institutional alignment.

Overlap is expected; functional distinction is decisive.

---

## VII. Why Corpus Documents Are Treated as Evidence, Not Truth

### Alternatives Considered
- Omniscient narrative summaries
- Authoritative chronologies
- Canonical “what really happened” accounts

### Why They Were Rejected
- Historical actors do not have omniscient access.
- Sources are biased, partial, and strategic.
- Contradiction is analytically valuable, not a flaw.

### Chosen Approach
Corpus documents are:
- situated artifacts,
- produced under constraint,
- preserved contingently,
- and interpreted critically.

They instantiate belief regimes and institutions without defining them.

---

## VIII. Why Narrative Coherence Is Subordinated

### Alternatives Considered
- Internal consistency as plausibility
- Character motivation as sufficiency
- Thematic justification

### Why They Were Rejected
- History is incoherent.
- Actors misjudge, contradict themselves, and fail.
- Systems collapse despite compelling narratives.

### Chosen Approach
Narrative coherence is permitted but **never sufficient**.

Plausibility is enforced by:
- constraint interaction,
- cost accumulation,
- and failure modes.

---

## IX. Why the Framework Is Intentionally Restrictive

### Alternatives Considered
- Flexible, permissive modeling
- Advisory rather than constraining rules

### Why They Were Rejected
- Permissiveness collapses into taste.
- Advisory systems do not prevent implausibility.
- Flexibility favors convenience over rigor.

### Chosen Approach
The framework is designed to:
- frustrate easy narratives,
- surface hidden assumptions,
- and force explicit justification.

Creativity occurs within constraint, not outside it.

## X. Relationship to Academic Traditions

The framework draws selectively from:
- historical sociology (constraints and capacity),
- qualitative process tracing (mechanism awareness),
- historiography (source criticism),
- systems engineering (failure analysis).

It deliberately avoids:
- prediction,
- simulation,
- statistical modeling,
- and analogy-driven validation.

It is not a theory of history.
It is a **method for falsifying implausible narratives**.

---

## XI. Intended Use and Non-Use

This framework is intended to:
- guide construction of analytical documents,
- constrain narrative claims,
- support rigorous fictional or historical modeling.

It is not intended to:
- replace historical scholarship,
- judge artistic merit,
- rank plausibility comparatively,
- or generate narratives autonomously.

---

## Closing Statement

Every abstraction in this framework exists because a broader or looser alternative was rejected.

Its rigor is not accidental.
Its constraints are not negotiable by convenience.
Its structure reflects a deliberate choice to privilege **what history resists** over what narrative desires.

Understanding these choices is optional.  
Adhering to them is not.
