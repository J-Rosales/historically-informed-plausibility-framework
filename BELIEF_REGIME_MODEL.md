This document defines how religions, cults, belief systems, and related phenomena are modeled in a compatible world repository **outside the diegetic world**.  
It exists to prevent anachronism, essentialism, and false coherence while supporting long-term narrative development.

This policy applies to documents under:
- `beliefs/`
- `cultures/` (where belief intersects with social structure)
- `periodization/` (where belief regimes affect temporal naming)

It does **not** govern diegetic narratives in `corpus/`.

---

## I. Core Principle

**Belief is modeled as historically contingent configurations, not timeless systems.**

There are no eternal religions in the repository.  
There are only **belief regimes**: bounded, partially coherent patterns of meaning, practice, and authority that are visible for a time and then transform, fragment, or disappear.

---

## II. Diegetic vs Non-Diegetic Separation

### Diegetic (in-world)
- Prayers, hymns, myths, polemics
- Laws invoking gods or doctrine
- Oral traditions and sacred narratives
- Accusations of heresy or impiety

These belong in `corpus/`.

### Non-Diegetic (out-of-world)
- Reconstructions of belief patterns
- Comparative descriptions across time and space
- Analytical grouping of practices and motifs
- Notes on evidence quality and bias

These belong in `beliefs/`, `cultures/`, or `periodization/`.

**No in-world actor has access to non-diegetic abstractions.**

---

## III. The Belief Regime Model

### Definition
A **belief regime** is a recognizable configuration of:
- motifs and cosmological assumptions
- ritual and social practices
- modes of transmission
- relationships to power and legitimacy

…that is *visible to observers* during a bounded span of time.

Belief regimes:
- may overlap
- may fragment internally
- may lack institutions or doctrine
- may be named only retrospectively or polemically

---

## IV. What Belief Regimes Are Not

Belief regimes are **not**:
- unified religions
- doctrinal systems
- canonical traditions
- claims about metaphysical truth
- stable cultural essences

Avoid language that implies:
- inevitability (“always believed”)
- universality (“the people believe”)
- coherence beyond evidence

---

## V. Time and Space Handling

### Temporal Boundaries
Timeframes represent **attestation and recognizability**, not origin or extinction.

Ranges may be:
- approximate
- overlapping
- regionally variable
- marked as diffuse or uncertain

A belief regime may:
- exist before it is attested
- persist after it stops being named
- survive only as fragments within successor regimes

### Spatial Boundaries
Geographic scope may be:
- core-based
- enclave-based
- itinerant
- network-driven
- poorly defined

Sharp borders are the exception, not the rule.

---

## VI. Organization Is Optional

Belief regimes may be:
- highly institutionalized
- loosely clustered
- entirely diffuse
- transmitted through individuals, not offices

For unorganized or poorly documented beliefs:
- focus on **carriers** (who transmits)
- focus on **motifs** (what recurs)
- document **fragmentation and ambiguity**

Do not invent hierarchy or canon to “complete” the picture.

---

## VII. Gods, Spirits, and Supernatural Entities

Deities and spirits are **narrative actors**, not stable analytical constants.

In the non-diegetic layer:
- describe *how people relate to them*
- describe *what roles they play in legitimacy, ritual, or explanation*
- do not define them as fixed entities across regimes

The same named figure may function differently across belief regimes.

---

## VIII. Change, Decline, and Replacement

Belief regimes end through:
- absorption into other regimes
- fragmentation into local variants
- loss of institutional support
- suppression or delegitimization
- gradual drift and reinterpretation

When a regime ends:
- do **not** update or overwrite the document
- create a **new** regime document for the successor configuration

Obsolete regimes remain valid as historical reference.

---

## IX. Relation to Other Repository Layers

- `corpus/`  
  May reflect, contest, or polemicize against belief regimes without naming them.
- `cultures/`  
  May reference belief regimes as part of social or political structure.
- `timeline/`  
  May reference belief regimes as historically recognized configurations, not truths.
- `constitution/`  
  Does not encode belief content; only structural constraints on plausibility.

---

## X. Naming and Provisionality

Belief regime names are:
- descriptive
- provisional
- non-normative

Include:
- alternate names
- hostile or polemical labels
- later scholarly terms

Avoid:
- theological judgments
- teleological framing
- presentist classification

---

## XI. Summary Rules

- Model belief as **configuration**, not system.
- Prefer **fuzziness** over false precision.
- Preserve **contradiction and plurality**.
- Never project later coherence backward.
- Keep belief modeling **non- confirmed, non-diegetic, and revisable**.

This policy exists to keep the repository historically honest, narratively fertile, and resistant to fossilization.

End of policy.
