# PLAUSIBILITY_EVALUATION_FRAMEWORK

## Purpose and Scope

This document defines **how plausibility is evaluated** within the Historically Informed Plausibility Framework.

It specifies:
- the evaluation posture adopted by the framework,
- the objects of evaluation,
- the sequence of evaluation steps,
- and the criteria by which narrative claims are judged plausible or implausible.

This framework does **not** prescribe narrative content, probabilities, or outcomes.  
It defines a **method of falsification**, not a method of prediction.

---

## I. Evaluation Posture

### I.1 Core Question

Plausibility evaluation asks:

> **Is there any structural reason this narrative claim cannot occur, given the defined constraints?**

The framework does **not** ask:
- whether an outcome is likely,
- whether it resembles known history,
- whether it is narratively satisfying.

An outcome is plausible unless it violates a constraint.

---

### I.2 Negative Orientation

Evaluation is:
- constraint-centered,
- pessimistic,
- failure-aware.

The framework privileges:
- impossibility over likelihood,
- breakdown over success,
- friction over flow.

This posture is deliberate and non-negotiable.

---

## II. Objects of Evaluation

Plausibility is evaluated against **claims**, not stories as a whole.

A claim may be:
- a narrative event,
- a process description,
- a structural transformation,
- a declared condition,
- or a described crisis.

Claims must be instantiated as **historical change entries** conforming to `HISTORICAL_CHANGE_ENTRY_FRAMEWORK.md`.

Claims that are not reducible to canonical entry types are **not evaluable**.

---

## III. Required Inputs for Evaluation

Every evaluation requires the following inputs:

1. One or more **Historical Change Entries**
2. The relevant **Consequence Lattices**
3. Any applicable **Analytical Lenses**
4. Supporting **Corpus Documents** (if available)
5. Declared **Belief Regimes** and institutional context

Absent inputs are treated as **unjustified assumptions**, not neutral gaps.

---

## IV. Evaluation Sequence (Mandatory)

Plausibility evaluation proceeds in the following order.  
Skipping steps invalidates the evaluation.

---

### IV.1 Entry Validation

Confirm that each claim:
- conforms to a canonical entry type,
- satisfies all framework requirements for that type,
- is internally coherent as an analytical unit.

Invalid entries are rejected prior to plausibility analysis.

---

### IV.2 Constraint Identification

Identify which consequence lattices are plausibly engaged by the claim.

This step answers:
- *Which structural constraints are stressed, altered, or relied upon?*

Lattices not engaged are irrelevant to evaluation.

---

### IV.3 Lattice Stress Assessment

For each engaged lattice, assess:

- direction of stress (increase, decrease, inversion),
- magnitude relative to system capacity,
- duration of applied stress,
- interaction with other stressed lattices.

This assessment is qualitative but must be explicit.

---

### IV.4 Saturation and Failure Testing

Determine whether any lattice:
- saturates,
- inverts,
- collapses,
- or enters an unstable regime

**Any unaddressed saturation constitutes a plausibility failure.**

Mitigations must be structural, not narrative.

---

### IV.5 Interaction Effects

Assess cross-lattice interaction:

- Does strain in one lattice amplify strain in another?
- Do mitigations for one lattice worsen another?
- Are tradeoffs acknowledged or suppressed?

Ignoring interaction effects is treated as a failure of analysis.

---

### IV.6 Actor-Level Interpretation Check

Evaluate whether actor decisions are consistent with:
- bounded knowledge,
- belief regimes,
- institutional position,
- and perceived constraints.

Perfect foresight, coordination, or rationality must be explicitly justified.

---

### IV.7 Derived Entry Justification (If Applicable)

If the claim involves:
- a Condition, or
- a Crisis

confirm that:
- derivation requirements are satisfied,
- underlying events/processes are cited,
- actor recognition is addressed,
- constraint modulation is specified.

Failure to justify derivation invalidates the entry.

---

## V. Outcomes of Evaluation

Evaluation produces one of the following outcomes:

### V.1 Plausible

No structural constraint is violated.  
Costs, delays, resistance, or degradation are acknowledged.

---

### V.2 Conditionally Plausible

No constraint is violated, but:
- key mitigations are underdeveloped,
- costs are deferred rather than denied,
- or secondary effects are unmodeled.

Further elaboration is required.

---

### V.3 Implausible

At least one of the following occurs:
- lattice saturation without mitigation,
- contradiction of institutional capacity,
- violation of irreversibility,
- costless large-scale change,
- actor omniscience without mechanism.

Implausibility is a **structural verdict**, not a narrative critique.

---

## VI. Common Failure Modes (Non-Exhaustive)

The following patterns frequently trigger implausibility:

- Costless reform
- Infinite resilience
- Latent conditions ignored until convenient
- Crisis declared without convergence
- Exceptional individuals substituting for structure
- Coherence mistaken for causality

These are diagnostic categories, not lattices.

---

## VII. Role of Corpus Documents in Evaluation

Corpus documents:
- support or contradict claims,
- reveal actor misperception,
- expose bias and omission.

They are **not adjudicators of truth**.

Contradictory documents strengthen analysis when handled explicitly.

---

## VIII. What Evaluation Does Not Do

This framework does **not**:
- assign probabilities,
- rank outcomes by realism,
- compare narratives competitively,
- guarantee historical accuracy,
- or ensure narrative quality.

It enforces **structural admissibility**, nothing more.

---

## IX. Iteration and Revision

Evaluation is iterative.

A failed claim may be revised by:
- adding cost,
- extending time horizons,
- introducing resistance,
- acknowledging degradation,
- or reclassifying the entry type.

Revision is preferred to abandonment.

---

## Guiding Principle

> A narrative claim is plausible not because it convinces,  
> but because it survives exposure to constraint.

Plausibility emerges from what remains after failure has been accounted for.
