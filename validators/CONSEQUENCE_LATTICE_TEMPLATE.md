# CONSEQUENCE LATTICE TEMPLATE

## Lattice Name

Concise, domain-focused noun phrase.
Avoid cultural, ideological, or aesthetic terms.

---

## 1. Domain Scope

Describe the systemic domain this lattice governs.

Specify:

* What this lattice constrains.
* What it explicitly does **not** cover.
* Boundaries with adjacent lattices.

---

## 2. Trigger Variables

List the pressures or conditions that cause this lattice to change state.

Triggers should be:

* Structural or environmental
* Observable in-world
* Independent of individual intent

---

## 3. State Levels

Define a small number of **ordinal states** (typically 3–5).

For each state:

* Provide a descriptive label.
* Describe the qualitative condition of the system.

Avoid metrics, numbers, or continuous scales.

---

## 4. Propagation Rules

Explain how and why the lattice transitions between states.

Include:

* Typical progression paths
* Irreversibility conditions (if any)
* Time horizons (fast / slow / generational)

---

## 5. Outputs and Constraints

Describe what becomes constrained, unstable, or impossible at each state.

Focus on:

* Institutional limits
* Behavioral impossibilities
* Narrative prohibitions

This is the **gating** function of the lattice.

---

## 6. Failure Modes

Describe what happens when the lattice saturates or collapses.

Failure modes should:

* Be systemic, not anecdotal
* Affect multiple actors or institutions
* Persist even if recognized

---

## 7. Typical Evidence

List the kinds of in-world evidence that indicate the lattice’s state.

Examples:

* Administrative records
* Legal anomalies
* Behavioral patterns
* Absences or silences in the corpus

---

## 8. Overlap and Orthogonality Analysis

Justify why this lattice is not reducible to existing lattices.

Explicitly state:

* Which lattices it overlaps with
* What failure mode it introduces that they do not

---

## 9. Notes on Lens Interaction (Optional)

List known lenses that commonly modify this lattice’s expression.

Do **not** embed lens behavior into the lattice definition.
