# CONSEQUENCE LATTICES
Soft-Validation Channel Scans for Second-Order Effects

This document defines compact "consequence lattices": short lists of impact channels that an agent must scan when a narrative introduces a major shock (plague, defeat, regime change, etc.).

These are not deterministic rules and do not adjudicate truth.
They exist to prevent omission of common second-order consequences.

## Usage
- When a shock is introduced, select the closest lattice(s).
- For each triggered lattice, scan channels and mark: Present / Unknown / Not Applicable.
- Discuss only the 3–6 most salient channels (ranked), unless the user requests exhaustive treatment.
- For each discussed channel, provide:
  - Immediate consequence (0–5 years, or local equivalent)
  - Delayed consequence (5–50 years, or local equivalent)
- If a consequence is intentionally omitted in the narrative, mark it as Unknown (intentional omission), not as Not Applicable.

## LATTICE: Population Shock (Plague, Mass Death, Exodus)
Channels to scan:
- Labor & production (agriculture, crafts, maintenance)
- Fiscal base (tax yield, rents, arrears, credit)
- Security & coercion (levy sizes, garrisons, policing)
- Land use (abandonment, rewilding, property disputes)
- Elite continuity (office vacancies, inheritance churn, loss of skill)
- Neighbor reaction (raids, annexation, refugee policy)
- Institutional continuity (records, training pipelines, specialist bottlenecks)
- Legitimacy & belief (scapegoats, ritual responses, heresy/polemic)

Typical failure modes:
- Recovery assumed to be linear
- Neighbors treated as passive
- Loss of specialists ignored (scribes, smiths, healers, engineers)
- Land treated as static rather than rewilding/fragmenting

---

## LATTICE: Military Defeat (Battle, Campaign Failure, Frontier Collapse)
Channels to scan:
- Manpower and future levy capacity
- Prestige and legitimacy loss
- Fiscal drain (ransom, reparations, emergency levies)
- Elite blame dynamics (purges, scapegoating, coups)
- Border security and opportunism (raids, client switching)
- Logistical degradation (stockpiles, transport, animals)
- Veteran loss and training gap
- Ideological reframing (prophecy, omens, doctrinal tightening)

Typical failure modes:
- Defeat has no political consequences
- Army reconstitutes instantly
- No opportunistic pressure from rivals

---

## LATTICE: Regime Change (Coup, Succession Crisis, Overthrow)
Channels to scan:
- Coalition restructuring (who gains/loses)
- Administrative continuity (who still executes orders)
- Security reallocation (guards, garrisons, purges)
- Fiscal renegotiation (arrears, confiscations, patronage)
- Law and precedent (amnesties, proscriptions, delegitimization)
- Diplomacy and recognition (neighbors test the new order)
- Narrative control (rituals, proclamations, iconoclasm)
- Long tail instability (rebellions, pretenders)

Typical failure modes:
- New regime inherits full capacity unchanged
- No resistance from displaced elites
- Foreign actors do not react

---

## LATTICE: Environmental Shock (Famine, Drought, Flood, Blight)
Channels to scan:
- Staple supply and price dynamics
- Migration and displacement
- Fiscal stress (relief vs extraction)
- Social unrest (riots, banditry, sects)
- Disease amplification
- Land use shifts and settlement contraction
- Neighbor pressure (raids, border disputes)
- Religious interpretation (taboos, sacrifices, reform)

Typical failure modes:
- Shock treated as one bad year
- No knock-on effects to legitimacy and movement

---

## LATTICE: Tech/Practice Disruption (New Weapon, Antimagic, Literacy Collapse)
Channels to scan:
- Skill bottlenecks and training pipelines
- Winner/loser re-stratification
- Institutional adaptation lag
- Black markets and illicit practice
- Ideological response (taboo, virtue, panic)
- Security shifts (fortification, policing, raids)
- Diplomatic realignment (new dependencies)
- Long-run path dependence (who locks in advantage)

Typical failure modes:
- Adoption is uniform and immediate
- No illicit continuation of displaced practice

---

## LATTICE: Belief Regime Shift (Revival, Schism, Suppression)
Channels to scan:
- Institutional enforcement (who can punish, who can preach)
- Popular practice vs elite doctrine gap
- Syncretism and local variation
- Coalition consequences (who gains legitimacy)
- Conflict triggers (heresy accusations, riots)
- International alignment (shared cult ties, missionary rivalry)
- Economic impacts (tithes, endowments, confiscations)
- Temporal lag and backlash

Typical failure modes:
- Instant doctrinal unity
- Total replacement of practice without residue
- No political beneficiaries
