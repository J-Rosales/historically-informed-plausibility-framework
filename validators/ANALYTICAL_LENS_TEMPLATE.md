# ANALYTICAL LENS TEMPLATE

## Lens Name

Concise, interpretable noun phrase.
May be culturally or contextually specific.

---

## 1. Domain of Application

Identify which consequence lattice(s) this lens modifies.

A lens must name at least one lattice.

---

## 2. Contextual Basis

Describe the cultural, social, technological, or ideological conditions that make this lens operative.

This should be:

* Historically contingent
* World- or culture-specific
* Replaceable in other settings

---

## 3. Mechanism of Action

Explain how the lens alters behavior, perception, or interpretation.

Typical mechanisms include:

* Social interpretation
* Reputation effects
* Normative expectation
* Symbolic meaning

---

## 4. Threshold Effects

Describe points where small deviations trigger disproportionate responses.

Focus on:

* Social sanction
* Loss of trust
* Reputation collapse
* Sudden norm shifts

---

## 5. Typical Expressions

List common surface manifestations produced by this lens.

Examples:

* Ritual behavior
* Violence patterns
* Etiquette enforcement
* Signaling actions

These are **expressive**, not constraining.

---

## 6. Interaction with Lattice States

Explain how the lens behaves differently depending on the lattice’s state.

For example:

* Stronger under strain
* Hollowed under saturation
* Inverted under collapse

---

## 7. Decay or Saturation Modes

Describe how the lens weakens, exhausts, or becomes counterproductive over time.

This section is mandatory to prevent eternal cultural effects.

---

## 8. Non-Gating Declaration

Explicitly state why this lens does **not** independently constrain plausibility.

If this cannot be written convincingly, the construct may be misclassified.

---

## 9. Notes on Promotion (Optional)

If there is an argument for this lens becoming a lattice in some settings, state it explicitly and conditionally.

---

## Final Design Note (implicit but enforceable)

If an author fills out:

* Sections 5–6 of the **lattice template** with mostly cultural description → it is probably a lens.
* Sections 3–5 of the **lens template** with structural impossibilities → it is probably a lattice.

These templates are intentionally shaped to surface that error early.
