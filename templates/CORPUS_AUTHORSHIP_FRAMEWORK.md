# CORPUS_AUTHORSHIP_FRAMEWORK

## Purpose and Scope

This document defines the principles governing **diegetic corpus documents**: texts, inscriptions, records, or other narrative artifacts that exist *within* a world and serve as evidentiary material for historical plausibility analysis.

It explains **why corpus documents are authored the way they are**, what kinds of information they must encode, and how they should be interpreted within the broader framework.

This document does **not** define specific document contents, genres, or examples.  
It governs *authorship, provenance, and interpretation*, not narrative substance.

## I. Definition: Corpus Document

A **corpus document** is a discrete, in-world artifact that:

- is produced by identifiable actors or institutions,
- reflects specific constraints, incentives, and perspectives,
- survives (or is known) through contingent processes of transmission,
- and serves as evidence rather than omniscient truth.

Corpus documents are the primary interface between narrative content and analytical structures.

---

## II. Role in Plausibility Analysis

Corpus documents exist to answer questions of the form:

- *Who believed or claimed this, and why?*
- *Under what constraints was this text produced?*
- *What does this document reveal — and conceal — about its context?*

They are **not** authoritative narrators.  
They are **situated claims** embedded in historical processes.

---

## III. Authorship as a Constraint

Authorship is not a neutral attribute.

Every corpus document must be understood as the product of:
- a social position,
- an institutional context,
- a set of incentives and risks,
- and a limited informational horizon.

Even anonymous or collective documents imply authorship conditions that constrain plausibility.

---

## IV. Audience and Purpose

Corpus documents are shaped by their intended audience.

A document written for:
- a ruler,
- a legal body,
- a congregation,
- or posterity

will differ in tone, content, and omission.

Purpose constrains:
- what may be said,
- what must be emphasized,
- what must remain implicit or unsaid.

---

## V. Transmission and Survival

No corpus document is assumed to survive intact by default.

Transmission history must be considered, including:
- copying practices,
- editorial intervention,
- material degradation,
- selective preservation.

Absence of evidence is itself a product of transmission constraints, not neutrality.

---

## VI. Bias, Reliability, and Silences

Corpus documents are not evaluated by truth value alone.

They must be assessed for:
- rhetorical intent,
- systematic bias,
- strategic omission,
- genre conventions.

A highly biased document may still be highly informative.

---

## VII. Relation to Analytical Structures

Corpus documents may interact with:
- belief regimes,
- institutions,
- consequence lattices,
- analytical lenses,
- periodization schemes.

They **instantiate** these structures but do not define them.

A corpus document may reflect strain, collapse, or transformation without recognizing it.

---

## VIII. Granularity and Multiplicity

Single documents do not define systems.

Plausibility emerges through:
- comparison across documents,
- contradictions between sources,
- variation across time and audience.

Multiplicity and inconsistency are expected and desirable.

---

## IX. Non-Omniscience Principle

Corpus documents must never be treated as omniscient.

They may:
- misunderstand causes,
- misattribute blame,
- overstate coherence,
- rationalize failure.

These limitations are analytically productive, not defects.

---

## X. Scope Limitations

This framework does **not**:
- prescribe literary style,
- require completeness,
- define historical truth,
- mandate specific metadata fields.

Those concerns are handled by templates and implementations.

---

## Guiding Principle

> A corpus document is evidence of how actors understood their world,  
> not a transparent account of how that world actually functioned.

Plausibility is preserved by treating documents as **situated artifacts**, not as narrative authorities.
