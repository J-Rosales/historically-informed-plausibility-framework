# BELIEF_REGIME_FRAMEWORK

## Purpose and Scope

This document defines the concept of a **belief regime** in the context of historically informed plausibility analysis.  
It provides authors with a structured approach to define and document belief regimes in a way that is:

- consistent with the underlying framework,
- amenable to plausibility analysis,
- and clearly separable from world-specific content.

This is a **framework document**; it does *not* enumerate specific belief regimes, doctrines, or historical faiths. Such instances belong in world or implementation repositories.

---

## I. Definition

A **belief regime** is an organized set of interrelated principles, assumptions, narratives, and practices that collectively shape how a group interprets the world, orders values, and justifies social norms.  
Belief regimes may encompass religious, philosophical, ideological, or cosmological commitments, but they are not limited to any single domain.

Belief regimes influence:
- individual and collective behavior,
- group identity and boundary formation,
- legitimation of authority and institutions,
- patterns of conflict and cooperation.

They are distinct from mere opinions or isolated conventions in that they exhibit *social coherence*, *transmission mechanisms*, and *cognitive or social anchoring*.

Belief regimes are not belief *contents*; they are **structural constructs** that organize belief contents into durable systems.

---

## II. Required Properties

To qualify as a belief regime in this framework, a construct must satisfy:

### 1. Socially Recognizable
It must be recognizable by participants and/or observers as a coherent set of principles or narratives.

### 2. Structurally Integrated
Its components must exhibit internal relationships (e.g., mutual reinforcement, explanatory linkages) such that they form a system rather than isolated assertions.

### 3. Persistent
It must exhibit temporal continuity across discrete social interactions, even if its specific contents evolve.

### 4. Collective Influence
It must materially shape practices, norms, or expectations at a group level (not purely idiosyncratic to individuals).

### 5. Transmission Mechanism
It must have identifiable means of transmission (rituals, texts, apprenticeship, socialization, symbols).

---

## III. Granularity, Overlap, and Regime Differentiation

Belief regimes are defined as **socially operative systems**, not as abstract families of ideas or retrospective taxonomies.

A belief regime should be documented as a distinct regime when differences between belief systems materially alter one or more of the following:
- recognized sources of authority,
- criteria of legitimacy or orthodoxy,
- enforcement of boundaries and sanctions,
- alignment with political, legal, or institutional power,
- expectations of acceptable social or moral behavior.

Shared narratives, symbols, texts, or historical origins do **not** imply a single regime.  
Overlap in belief content is expected and does not negate functional distinction.

Large umbrella categories that aggregate internally divergent systems are discouraged.  
Such aggregation is permissible only when explicitly defined as abstract, genealogical, or non-operative, and must not be treated as directly explanatory of behavior or institutional alignment.

As a practical test:  
If contemporaneous actors treat one another as illegitimate, dangerous, or socially incompatible on the basis of belief, they constitute separate belief regimes for the purposes of this framework.


## IV. Authoring Interface

Authors defining a belief regime *instance* should address the following sections. These sections serve as a **structured guide**, not as constraints on creativity.

### A. Identification

- **Canonical Name:** The formal or scholarly label for this regime.
- **Alternate Names:** Exonyms, polemical names, retrospective labels.
- **Primary Carriers:** Who practices, transmits, or embodies this regime.
- **Degree of Organization:** Informal/ diffuse · networked/ clustered · institutionalized.

### B. Temporal Scope

- **Earliest Attestation:** Approximate point of first identifiable coherence.
- **Peak Visibility:** Periods of prominence (if any).
- **Last Distinct References:** When it fades, transforms, or dissolves.
- **Chronological Notes:** Uncertainty, retrospective lensing, terminological drift.

### C. Spatial Scope

- **Core Areas:** Regions of densest adoption or origin.
- **Peripheral Presence:** Networked, diasporic, or itinerant footprints.
- **Mobility Pattern:** Sedentary · itinerant · networked.

### D. Structural Components

- **Core Narratives:** Foundational stories, cosmologies, or explanatory accounts.
- **Principles and Tenets:** Normative claims about world order and value.
- **Symbolic Assets:** Myths, rites, symbols, artifacts that communicate coherence.

### E. Practices and Observances

- Rituals, taboos, rites of passage, calendrical observances, ethics.

### F. Social Carriers and Transmission

- Mechanisms of reproduction (lineage, schools, clergy, trade, conquest).
- Modes of teaching and reinforcement (oral, textual, ritual).

### G. Internal Variation

- Recognized sects, factions, tolerated contradictions, syncretic trends.

### H. Relation to Power

- How the regime is treated by institutions of authority (legitimizing, tolerated, suppressed, instrumentalized).

### I. External Perceptions

- How outsiders describe, misinterpret, or oppose it.
- Polemical or pejorative labels.

### J. Transformation and Dissolution

- Processes by which the regime adapts, fragments, blends with others, or fades.

### K. Evidentiary Conditions

- Types of sources available.
- Biases and limitations of those sources.
- What remains unknown or unresolvable.

## V. Functional Roles in Plausibility Analysis

Belief regimes may be used to:

- explain *why* actors interpret their circumstances in particular ways,
- mediate how incentives and constraints are perceived,
- shape legitimacy structures,
- interact with consequence lattices indirectly through lenses.

Belief regimes influence plausibility, but they are **not themselves consequence lattices** (unless explicitly defined as such in a given world by clear justification).

---

## VI. Distinction Between Framework and Implementation

This document defines **how to construct** a belief regime definition, not **which ones exist**.

Belief regime instances should be defined **outside** this framework in:

- implementation repositories,
- world libraries,
- setting profiles.

Belief regime catalogs in world repos should use this framework for consistency.

---

## VII. Templates and Examples

A *template* for belief regime definition is available separately (`BELIEF_REGIME_TEMPLATE.md`).  
Concrete examples should be placed in an `examples/` directory or in world implementations, **not** in the framework.

---

## VIII. Overlap and Orthogonality

Belief regimes may interact with:

- consequence lattices (e.g., legitimacy strain),
- lenses (e.g., cultural compliance pressure),
- temporal constructs (periodization),
- corpus artifacts (narrative documents).

Authors should document overlap and justify why their regime is *distinct and structural* rather than a derivative pattern.

---

## IX. Non-Gating Declaration

A belief regime description does **not** by itself constrain narrative plausibility.  
It only contributes explanatory structure when interpreted through the lenses and lattices defined by an implementation.

---

## X. Evolution and Decay

Belief regimes are dynamic. Authors should document:

- mechanisms of innovation and persistence,
- pressures leading to fragmentation or synthesis,
- thresholds where coherence collapses or reforms.

This supports plausibility analysis of regime transformation.

---

## Guiding Principle

> A belief regime organizes meaning-making structures that persist across social contexts and materially influence behavior, interpretation, and institution-forming pressures.

Belief regimes are **systems of coherence**, not mere lists of beliefs.
