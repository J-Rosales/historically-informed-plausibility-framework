## Internal Commentary (Optional)

Later marginal annotations in some manuscript traditions comment on classical allusions and rhetorical flourishes, suggesting use as a learned text.

---

## External Commentary (Analytical)

The Alexiad functions as a paradigmatic example of court historiography: simultaneously invaluable for factual detail and structurally constrained by apologetic intent. Its narrative coherence should be read as a product of genre and position rather than as neutral synthesis.

## Author Notes

This document should be treated as a **situated elite narrative**, not a comprehensive account of the Komnenian period. Cross-referencing with non-court sources is required to reconstruct systemic conditions beyond the author’s horizon.
